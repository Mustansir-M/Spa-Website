            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>Historians can trace our use of beauty products and cosmetics back to 4,000 BC, and the ancient Egyptians who used kohl to create dramatic eyes. Today, the worldwide beauty industry, which covers everything from hair and skin care to make-up is an estimated $425 billion industry. The history of the beauty industry is as diverse and colorful as the lipsticks and nail polishes on display at your local make-up counter.</p>

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to enrich, enhance & encourage individuals through their beauty. We strive for excellence by setting goals, educating & communicating with our guests and each other. </p>

            <h1>Our Vision</h1>
            <p>It is our vision to be a salon where everyone feels comfortable and welcome.
            Our goal is that every client receives an outstanding service from the time they walk in, to the time they walk out. We want our clients to love us so much that they would refer us their friends, their family, and even complete strangers who approach them at the grocery store. We aim to create Relaxxa enthusiasts.</p>
